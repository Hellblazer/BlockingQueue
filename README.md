# BlockingQueue
Tutorial-style talk "Weeks of debugging can save you hours of TLA+".  The inspiration  for this tutorial and definitive background reading material (with spoilers) is ["An Example of Debugging Java with a Model Checker
"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html) by [Michel Charpentier](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/).  I believe it all goes back to [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen) of the c2 wiki.

Each [git commit](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue/commits/tutorial) introduces a new TLA+ concept.  Go back to the very first commit to follow along!

[Click here for a zero-install environment to give the TLA+ specification language a try](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue).

### v02: State graph for minimum configuration p1c1b1.
    
Initial TLA+ spec that models the existing (Java) code with all its
bugs and shortcomings.
    
The model uses the minimal parameters (1 producer, 1 consumer, and
a buffer of size one) possible.  When TLC generates the state graph with
```java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -dump dot p1c1b1.dot BlockingQueue```,
we can visually verify that no deadlock is possible with this
configuration: ![p1c1b1](./p1c1b1.svg).

### v01: Java implementation with configuration p4c3b3.
    
Legacy Java code with all its bugs and shortcomings.  At this point
in the tutorial, we only know that the code can exhibit a deadlock,
but we don't know why.
    
What we will do is play a game with the universe (non-determinism).
Launch the Java app with ```java -cp impl/src/ org.kuppe.App``` in
the background and follow along with the tutorial.  If the Java app
deadlocks before you finish the tutorial, the universe wins.

### v00: IDE setup, nothing to see here.
    
Add IDE setup for VSCode online and gitpod.io.
