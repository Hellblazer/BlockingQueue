# BlockingQueue
Tutorial-style talk "Weeks of debugging can save you hours of TLA+".  The inspiration  for this tutorial and definitive background reading material (with spoilers) is ["An Example of Debugging Java with a Model Checker
"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html) by [Michel Charpentier](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/).  I believe it all goes back to [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen) of the c2 wiki.

Each [git commit](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue/commits/tutorial) introduces a new TLA+ concept.  Go back to the very first commit to follow along!

### v08: Non-deterministically notify waiting threads.

Non-deterministically notify waiting threads in an attempt to
fix the deadlock situation.  This attempt fails because we
might end up waking the wrong thread up over and over again.

### v07: Add visualization of error-traces.
    
The trace with 2 procs, 1 cons, and a buffer of length 1 is
minimal (length 8).  The other trace shows how quickly the
issue becomes a) incomprehensible and b) the length of the
trace increases (46 states for 7 threads).  TLC takes 75 secs
on my machine to check this.

![Animation for configuration p4c3b3](animation/BlockingQueue-Proc4_Cons3_Buff3_Len46.gif)

The animations are created in the Toolbox with:

1. Check model [BlockingQueue.cfg](BlockingQueue.cfg)
2. Set ```Animation``` as the trace expression in the Error-Trace console
3. Hit Explore and export/copy the resulting trace to clipboard
4. Paste into http://localhost:10996/files/animator.html

Without the Toolbox, something similar to this:

1. Check model [BlockingQueue.cfg](BlockingQueue.cfg) with ```java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -generateSpecTE BlockingQueue``` ('-generateSpecTE' causes TLC to generate [SpecTE.tla](SpecTE.tla)/.cfg)
2. State trace expression ```Animation``` ([BlockingQueueAnim.tla](BlockingQueueAnim.tla))in SpecTE.tla
3. Download https://github.com/tlaplus/CommunityModules/releases/download/20200107.1/CommunityModules-202001070430.jar
4. Check SpecTE with ```java -jar tla2tools.jar:CommunityModules-202001070430.jar tlc2.TLC SpecTE```
5. Copy trace into http://localhost:10996/files/animator.html (minor format changes needed)

### v06: Add prophecy variable to simplify animation.

The next-state relation has been restated to "predict"
the value of t (threads) in the successor state. We
will use the prophecy variable in the following
commit to come up with an animation.
    
This and the following commit can be skipped unless
you are interested in the more advanced concept of
prophecy (http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/auxiliary.pdf)
or animations (https://youtu.be/mLF220fPrP4).

### v05: Add Invariant to detect deadlocks.

Add Invariant to detect deadlocks (and TypeInv). TLC now finds the deadlock
for configuration p1c2b1 (see below) as well as the one matching the Java
app p4c3b3.

```tla
Error: Invariant Invariant is violated.
Error: The behavior up to this point is:
State 1: <Initial predicate>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {}

State 2: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c1}

State 3: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c1, c2}

State 4: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {c2}

State 5: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c2}

State 6: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1}

State 7: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c1}

State 8: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c1, c2}
```

### v04: Debug state graph for configuration p2c1b1.
    
In the previous step, we looked at the graphical representation of the state
graph.  With the help of TLCExt!PickSuccessor we build us a debugger
with which we study the state graph interactively.  We learn that with
configuration p2c1b1 there are two deadlock states:

![PickSuccessor](./screencasts/v04-PickSuccessor.gif)

The [CommunityModules](https://github.com/tlaplus/CommunityModules) release has to be added to TLC's command-line:

```
java -cp tla2tools.jar:CommunityModules.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock BlockingQueue
```

Note that TLC's ```-continue``` flag would have also worked to find both
deadlock states.

### v03: State graph for configurations p1c2b1 and p2c1b1.
    
Slightly larger configuration with which we can visually spot the
deadlock: ![p1c2b1](./p1c2b1.svg).

BlockingQueueDebug.tla/.cfg shows how to interactively explore a
state graph for configuration p2c1b1 with TLC in combination with
GraphViz (xdot):

![Explore state graph](./screencasts/v03-StateGraph.gif)

```
java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -dump dot,snapshot p2c1b1.dot BlockingQueueDebug
```

### v02: State graph for minimum configuration p1c1b1.
    
Initial TLA+ spec that models the existing (Java) code with all its
bugs and shortcomings.
    
The model uses the minimal parameters (1 producer, 1 consumer, and
a buffer of size one) possible.  When TLC generates the state graph with
```java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -dump dot p1c1b1.dot BlockingQueue```,
we can visually verify that no deadlock is possible with this
configuration: ![p1c1b1](./p1c1b1.svg).

### v01: Java implementation with configuration p4c3b3.
    
Legacy Java code with all its bugs and shortcomings.  At this point
in the tutorial, we only know that the code can exhibit a deadlock,
but we don't know why.
    
What we will do is play a game with the universe (non-determinism).
Launch the Java app with ```java -cp impl/src/ org.kuppe.App``` in
the background and follow along with the tutorial.  If the Java app
deadlocks before you finish the tutorial, the universe wins.

### v00: IDE setup, nothing to see here.
    
Add IDE setup for VSCode online and gitpod.io.
